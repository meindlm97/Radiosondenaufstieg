   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Radiosondenaufstieg's documentation!
===============================================
The following task was worked on within this project:

Read in a radiosonde data set and plot a tephigram with the temperature and humidity line. You can download radiosonde data yourself in "Text: List" format from the following website: *http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html*. Work with small blocks of code, i.e. outsource individual programming steps in functions (e.g. reading the data). Use docstrings and create program documentation using Sphinx. This documentation should describe in a few words what was done, what data was used and the result plot is shown (as an example). Add a basemapplot by marking the location of the radiosonde ascent and add this to the Sphinx documentation.

My project depends on the following packages:

* Matplotlib (Pyplot)
* Numpy
* Tephigram
* Basemap
