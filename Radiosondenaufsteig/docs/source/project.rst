Project Summary
===============

Goals Achived
-------------
Goal 1 - Plotting Tephigram

With the help of the Tephigram module and a data set containing measurement data, a so-called Tephigram was plotted with the appropriate methods, which contains a temperature and a humidity line.

Goal 2 - Plotting Basemap-Card

With the help of the basemap module, a geographic map was plotted with the appropriate methods, which contains the ascent point of the radiosonde.

Lessons Learned
---------------
Under implementation of this project, it was made clear how easy it is to process and output meteorological trade fair data with just a few steps. In addition, the basemap module was used to create a geographical map in which the place of ascent was marked. These two programming steps were then documented.
